	abstract = {A dynamic model is derived for misaligned rotor-ball bearing systems driven through a flexible coupling by treating the reaction loads and deformations at the bearing and coupling elements as the misalignment effect. In order to verify the validity of the misaligned rotor system model, experiments are extensively carried out with a laboratory test rig. Both the experimental and simulation results agree well in that, as the angular misalignment increases, the whirling orbits tend to collapse toward a straight line and the natural frequency of the misaligned rotor system associated with the misalignment direction increases largely. It is found that the increase in natural frequency is mostly due to the increase in effective bearing moment stiffness associated with the misalignment direction.}

	abstract = {This paper analyzes the deformation of a hexangular flexible coupling connecting two rigid rotors which have angular and parallel misalignment and calculates the dynamic reaction force varying with rotational angle. A 6 degree-of-freedom (DOF) dynamic model including the two rigid rotors connected by the hexangular flexible coupling is established by using Lagrange method. The high order Runge-Kutta algorithm is applied to solve the differential equations and to calculate vibration response of the coupled rotors with parallel or angular misalignment or combined misalignment. The rotor vibration amplitude and frequency information are acquired by Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) analysis. The relationship between vibration responses of first, second and third order components and moving orbits of the coupled rotors with or without misalignment at different rotational speed are numerically simulated. The results provide a theoretical support for fault diagnosis and detection of rotating machinery connected by hexangular flexible coupling.}

	abstract = {Shaft misalignment and rotor unbalance are major concerns in rotating machinery. In order to understand the dynamic characteristics of these machinery faults, a theoretical model of a complete motor-flexible coupling-rotor system capable of describing the mechanical vibration resulting from misalignment and unbalance was developed. The universal joint effect was included in the model to take the misalignment effect into account. Generalized system equations of motion for a system under misalignment and unbalance conditions were derived using the component mode synthesis technique. The derived equations indicate that the forcing frequencies due to shaft misalignment are even multiple frequencies of the motor rotational speed. The system response depends heavily on the relation between the system natural frequencies and the motor rotational speed. If any of the even multiples of the motor rotational speed is at or close to one of the system natural frequencies, a resonance condition occurs. As a result of this, the vibrations induced by misalignment are amplified into major vibration sources.}
